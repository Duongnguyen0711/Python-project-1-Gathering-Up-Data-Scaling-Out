Gathering Up Data &amp; Scaling Out

In this project, I will produce a Python program to combine 4 data files that are provided in a variety of formats (CSV, JSON, XML, and TXT) and push them to a central organizational data store. 
The work herein is to process these data into a homogeneous record, aligning the same customers from different sources together, which are then automatically entered into a Relational Database System using modern tools & libraries.
These unified records are then to be mapped to a relational database using PonyORM, with all unified records being entered into the database.
